<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Background</strong></h2>
<hr>
<h5> The World Health Organization has elevated <strong>JN.1</strong> from a <strong>variant under monitoring (VUM) to a variant of interest (VOI)</strong> on 18 December 2023, and it has become the dominating strain across the globe. Recently, the <strong>KP.2</strong> variant, a descendant of JN.1, is designated as a VUM on <strong>3 May 2024</strong>, swiftly after its emergence.<a href='https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants'>[1]</a></h5>

<h5>The KP.2 variant exhibits 2 distinct mutations in RBD, <strong>R346T</strong> and <strong>F456L</strong>, as depicted by its nickname "FLiRT", accompanied by <strong>V1104L</strong> in S2, in comparison with the JN.1 strain. <strong>Amino acid residues 346 and 456</strong>, located within epitopes which are targets of neutralizing antibodies, have been observed undergoing substitutions in past variants, like R346T in BQ.1 & XBB, and F456L in EG.5 & HK.3.<a href='https://www.who.int/news/item/26-04-2024-statement-on-the-antigen-composition-of-covid-19-vaccines'>[2]</a></h5>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Featured Mutations: L455S, F456L</strong></h2>
<hr>
<h5>As a characteristic mutation of the JN.1 variant, <strong>L455S</strong> was discovered at the beginning of the epidemic of JN.1. On the one hand, it reduced the binding capacity of RBD-ACE2 during in vitro ACE2 binding tests, but on the other hand, it increased viral infection in pseudovirus tests (using BA.2.86 strain as a reference).<a href='https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(23)00813-7/fulltext'>[3]</a> This result may be caused by L455S altering the RBD open-close conformation dynamics at the partially open stage.<a href='https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2100943118'>[4]</a> The substitution of leucine with serine results in a shift from a non-polar to a polar amino acid, causing an increased hydrophilicity, which could drive the exposure of the receptor binding motif to solvent. Now that the <strong>F456L</strong> mutation continues to occur and the hydrophobicity is further reduced, we can speculate that the spike protein is gaining a higher opening tendency.</h5>
